# Architecture Blueprint for Language Learning Agent Project

This blueprint documents the architecture of the agent-based system from the provided code, incorporating the reflection pattern as previously requested and emphasizing the use of Google's embedding model 001 for vector embeddings. The system is a conversational AI for language learning, leveraging LangChain and Google Generative AI to process queries, generate exercises, perform searches, and dynamically update a vector store with responses for ongoing reflection.

## Overall System Architecture

The system creates an interactive, retrieval-augmented pipeline for personalized language learning. It extracts text from PDFs for seed knowledge, embeds content using Google's embedding model 001 in a persistent Chroma vector store, integrates tools for web search and exercise generation, and employs a ReAct agent to handle conversational queries. Responses are logged to Markdown and added to the vector store, enabling reflection on past interactions to enhance future outputs. Core elements include ingestion, embedding with the specified model, tool orchestration, agent planning with reflection, and self-evolving storage.

## Applied Agentic AI Patterns

The system applies the following patterns from Agentic AI design principles:

- **Tool Use Pattern**: Explicitly implemented. Tools such as TavilySearch for up-to-date web information and PracticeExerciseGenerator for JSON-based exercises extend the agent's functionality.
- **Planning Pattern**: Incorporated through the ReAct mechanism in the STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION agent, which reasons to plan tool calls and integrate context.
- **Reflection Pattern**: Enabled via chat history and dynamic vector store updates. The agent reflects on stored responses (including timestamps) during its loop, critiquing and refining based on prior outputs for improved relevance.
- **Multi-Agent Pattern**: Not applied. Operations are managed by a single agent.


## Flow of Data, Control, and Decision-Making

1. **Data Ingestion**: PDF text is extracted with PyPDF2 and converted to documents; agent responses are similarly captured with metadata.
2. **Embedding and Storage**: Documents are processed using Google's embedding model 001 (via GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings) and stored in Chroma for similarity retrieval and reflective updates.
3. **Query Enhancement**: User inputs are combined with retrieved context and chat history for reflective prompting.
4. **Agent Control Flow**: The agent handles the prompt in a ReAct loop, reflecting on history to reason, invoke tools (e.g., generating exercises), observe results, and iterate.
5. **Decision-Making**: ReAct logic assesses query, context, and past interactions to guide actions, such as refining an exercise based on reflected prior feedback.
6. **Output Generation**: Responses are displayed, appended to Markdown, and stored in the vector store using the embedding model, facilitating future reflection.

Control is agent-centric, with data loops supporting reflection through storage and history.

## Roles of Agents, Tools, Functions, and Collaboration

- **Agent**: Orchestrates the system (STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION type), planning actions, invoking tools, and reflecting on history to produce tailored responses. It collaborates by mediating inputs/outputs and leveraging embedded context.
- **Tools/Functions**:
    - TavilySearch: Delivers current language data from the web, aiding reflective fact-checking.
    - PracticeExerciseGenerator: Creates structured exercises with the LLM, building on reflected past sessions.
- **Collaboration**: The agent directs tools in its loop, using embeddings from model 001 for context retrieval. Reflection occurs via history integration, with no direct tool interactionsâ€”all mediated by the agent for cohesive outputs.


## Involved Components: LLMs, Vector Stores, Tools, Databases, APIs

- **LLM**: Google Generative AI (gemini-1.5-flash via ChatGoogleGenerativeAI) for reasoning, generation, and tool support.
- **Vector Store**: Chroma (persistent "chroma_db"), utilizing Google's embedding model 001 for document embeddings and retrieval.
- **Tools**: TavilySearch for queries; PracticeExerciseGenerator with LLM prompts.
- **Databases**: Chroma serves as the primary vector database.
- **APIs**: Google API for the embedding model 001 and chat; Tavily API for search; LangChain for integrations; PyPDF2 for extraction.
- **Other**: Environment variables for keys; datetime for timestamps; Markdown appending for logs.
