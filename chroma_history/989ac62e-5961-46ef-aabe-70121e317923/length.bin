WORLD WAR I RESOURCES CAUSES OF WORLD WAR I World War I occurred between July 1914 and November 11, 1918. By the end of the war, over 17 million people would be killed including over 100,000 American troops. The reason why war erupted is actually much more complicated than a simple list of causes. While there was a chain of events that directly led to the fighting, the actual root causes are much deeper and part of continued debate and discussion. This list is an overview of the most popular reasons that are cited as the root causes of World War 1. 1. Mutual Defense Alliances Over time, countries throughout Europe made mutual defense agreements that would pull them into battle. These treaties meant that if one country was attacked, allied countries were bound to defend them. Before World War 1, the following alliances existed:  Russia and Serbia  Germany and Austria-Hungary  France and Russia  Britain and France and Belgium  Japan and Britain Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, Russia got involved to defend Serbia. Germany seeing Russia mobilizing, declared war on Russia. France was then drawn in against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Germany attacked France through Belgium pulling Britain into war. Then Japan entered the war. Later, Italy and the United States would enter on the side of the allies. 2. Imperialism Imperialism is when a country increases their power and wealth by bringing additional territories under their control. Before World War I, Africa and parts of Asia were points of contention among the European countries. This was especially true because of the raw materials these areas could provide. The increasing competition and desire for greater empires led to an increase in confrontation that helped push the world into WW I. 3. Militarism As the world entered the 20th century, an arms race had begun. By 1914, Germany had the greatest increase in military buildup. Great Britain and Germany both greatly increased their navies in this time period. Further, in Germany and Russia particularly, the military establishment began to have a greater influence on public policy. This increase in militarism helped push the countries involved into war. . 4. Nationalism Much of the origin of the war was based on the desire of the Slavic peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina to no longer be part of Austria Hungary but instead be part of Serbia. In this way, nationalism led directly to the War. But in a more general way, the nationalism of the various countries throughout Europe contributed not only to the beginning but the extension of the war in Europe. Each country tried to prove their dominance and power 5. Immediate Cause: Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand The immediate cause of World War I that made the aforementioned items come into play (alliances, imperialism, militarism, nationalism) was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary. In June 1914, a Serbian-nationalist terrorist group called the Black Hand sent groups to assassinate the Archduke. Their first attempt failed when a driver avoided a grenade thrown at their car. However, later that day a Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip assassinated him and his wife while they were in Sarajevo, Bosnia which was part of Austria-Hungary. This was in protest to Austria-Hungary having control of this region. Serbia wanted to take over Bosnia and Herzegovina. This assassination led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia. When Russia began to mobilize due to its alliance with Serbia, Germany declared war on Russia. Thus began the expansion of the war to include all those involved in the mutual defense alliances. Taken from About Education: The Top 5 Causes That Led to World War I WORLD WAR I – SUMMARY OF EVENTS THE START OF THE WAR The assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand (June 28, 1914) was the main catalyst for the start of the Great War (World War I). After the assassination, the following series of events took place:  July 28 - Austria declared war on Serbia.  August 1 – As Austria’s ally, Germany declares war on Russia, an ally of Serbia  August 3 – Germany declares war on France, an ally of Russia and immediately begins an invasion of neutral Belgium  August 4 – Great Britain, an ally of France, declares war against Germany  The United States (President Wilson) declares that the United States will remain neutral THE WESTERN AND EASTERN FRONTS The first month of combat consisted of bold attacks and rapid troop movements on both fronts. In the west, Germany attacked first Belgium and then France. In the east, Russia attacked both Germany and Austria-Hungary. In the south, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia. Following the Battle of the Marne (September 5–9, 1914), the western front became entrenched in central France and remained that way for the rest of the war. The fronts in the east also gradually locked into place. THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE Late in 1914, the Ottoman Empire was brought into the fray as well, after Germany tricked Russia into thinking that Turkey had attacked it. As a result, much of 1915 was dominated by Allied actions against the Ottomans in the Mediterranean. First, Britain and France launched a failed attack on the Dardanelles. This campaign was followed by the British invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula. Britain also launched a separate campaign against the Turks in Mesopotamia. Although the British had some successes in Mesopotamia, the Gallipoli campaign and the attacks on the Dardanelles resulted in British defeats. TRENCH WARFARE The middle part of the war, 1916 and 1917, was dominated by continued trench warfare in the east. Both sides had built a series of trenches that went from the North Sea and through Belgium and France. Soldiers fought from dug-in positions, striking at each other with machine guns, heavy artillery, and chemical weapons. The land between the two enemy trench lines was called “No Man’s Land.” This land was sometimes covered with barbed wire and land mines. The enemy trenches were generally around 50 to 250 yards apart. Though soldiers died by the millions in brutal conditions, neither side had any substantive success or gained any advantage. THE UNITED STATES’ ENTRANCE AND RUSSIA’S EXIT Despite the stalemate on both fronts in Europe, two important developments in the war occurred in 1917. In early April, the United States, angered by attacks upon its ships in the Atlantic, declared war on Germany. Then, in November, the Bolshevik Revolution prompted Russia to pull out of the war. THE END OF THE WAR AND ARMISTICE Although both sides launched renewed offensives in 1918 in an all-or-nothing effort to win the war, both efforts failed. The fighting between exhausted, demoralized troops continued to plod along. In August – September, an Allied offensive along the Meuse River and through the Argonne Forest succeeded in driving an exhausted German army backward toward the German border. A deadly outbreak of influenza, meanwhile, took heavy tolls on soldiers of both sides. Eventually, the governments of both Germany and Austria-Hungary began to lose control as both countries experienced multiple mutinies from within their military structures. On November 11, 1918, the Germans signed an armistice in which they agreed to surrender their arms, give up much of their navy, and evacuate occupied territory. REASONS FOR U.S. ENTRY INTO WORLD WAR I The United States played a crucial role in the outcome of World War I and the subsequent peace treaty, however, the country tried very hard to stay neutral throughout most of the conflict which it saw as a European affair. By 1917, Woodrow Wilson's policy and public opinion changed in favor of the US entry into World War I for the following 5 reasons that are described below. German Atrocities in Belgium One factor that had a major influence on American public opinion was the invasion of neutral Belgium and stories of German atrocities in the country which shocked and outraged the Americans. Stories of unarmed civilians being killed and small towns being destroyed circulated throughout the press. Although some of the stories were British propaganda, they left a strong anti-German sentiment among Americans. Economic Interests The American businessmen were very interested in the Allied victory and many such as J.P. Morgan helped fund British and French war efforts with approximately $3 billion in loans and bond purchases. If the Allies would be defeated by the Central Powers, they probably wouldn’t be able to repay their debt to their US lenders. Many businessmen therefore supported the so-called ‘Preparedness Movement’ which campaigned for the US intervention in the war on the side of the Allied forces. Sinking of the Lusitania In May 1915, a German U-boat sunk the British passenger ship Lusitania off the coast of Ireland. Over 1,000 passengers were killed, including 128 Americans. Although the ship may have been carrying military equipment along with the civilians, the Americans were infuriated because the people on board weren’t warned before the sinking. In addition to straining diplomatic relations between the US and Germany, the Sinking of the Lusitania further increased anti-German sentiment in America. Unrestricted Submarine Warfare In response to Britain’s blockade, Germany turned to unrestricted submarine warfare to keep goods from reaching Britain. After the Sinking of the Lusitania, Germany promised to stop unrestricted submarine warfare but within less than one year, they torpedoed another passenger ship - the cross-English Channel ferry Sussex. Again, the Germans promised not to attack passenger ships without warning (the Sussex Pledge). But that pledge was short lived as well. Zimmermann Telegram In 1917, German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann sent a telegram to Mexico suggesting that if the US should declare war on Germany, Mexico should declare war on the US In return, Mexico would get back the territory lost in the Mexican-American War (Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona). Unfortunately for Germany, the telegram was intercepted by the British and hurriedly given to the Americans. Although Mexico had no real intention of declaring war on the US, the publication of the letter further mobilized the American people against the Central Powers.

He received his B.S. in history from Indiana State University in 2015. He can be reached at cjmcbrid@umail.iu.edu. Since there have been Hoosiers, there have been Hoosier willing to serve and sacrifice for their nation and its ideals. The state of Indiana is represented in every major United States war since the state’s founding and as of the twentieth century, hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers had served their country proudly. By April of 1917, Indiana had demonstrated their willingness and capability to serve and following the United States’ declaration of war, Hoosiers were ready to step up and serve their nation. Sgt. Alex L Arch of South Bend, soldier who pulled the lanyard to fire the first American shot of World War I Indiana’s soldiers and civilians quickly mobilized for war. Organizations both public and private adapted to meet the demands of war. Many Indiana companies, such as the Studebaker Corporation, placed their factories “at the disposal of the government.” In the case of Studebaker, they converted half of their plant capacity to the production of military equipment including artillery and supply chassis and wagons. The Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical Company offered $25,000 in funding for medical equipment to form Base Hospital 32, which would be comprised primarily of personnel from Indiana and would treat almost 9,700 patients in France throughout the war. Local newspapers and businesses encouraged the citizenry to purchase war bonds, to conserve supplies, and to otherwise support the war effort. Throughout the state, Hoosiers quickly got to work. Enlisted Hoosiers went overseas with the first units to land on European soil. Among them, Sergeant Alex Arch of South Bend, Indiana was credited with having fired the first shot of the war for the United States, pulling the lanyard to fire the first American artillery shell towards German lines. As well as the first strike, the first blow was received by Indiana as well. The first three American casualties of the war included young Corporal James Gresham of Evansville, Indiana who died in hand to hand combat while repelling a German trench raid near Bathelemont in France. Hoosiers such as these cemented the state’s legacy as among the first to strike at the enemy and the first to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country. As the first of the American Expeditionary Forces were arriving in France, the Indiana National Guard was quickly mobilizing. Units from the Indiana and Kentucky National Guards would form the 38th Division and the 84th “Lincoln” Division would be comprised of guard units from Indiana, Kentucky, and Illinois. In addition, the famed 150th artillery regiment, which had gained a fierce reputation in the Civil War under the command of Captain Eli Lilly, was selected as one of the handpicked units to make up the 42nd “Rainbow” Division. This division would see some of the most intense fighting of the war. The 150th Field Artillery, under the capable leadership of Colonel Robert Tyndall, would take part in six major engagements throughout the war. The first day of draft registration, June 05, 1917, passed without incident in Indiana. During that first period, over 260,000 Hoosiers came forward to register. Over 400,000 more had registered by the war’s end. Throughout the war, Hoosier men and women would time and time again prove their unwavering courage and loyalty to their country in spite of the many faces of adversity. Lieutenant Aaron Fisher of Lyle’s Station, Indiana would become the most highly decorated African American soldier from Indiana during the war for his extraordinary courage and level-headed leadership in the face of overwhelming odds. Fisher received the Distinguished Service Cross and the French Croix de Guerre for refusing to retreat or surrender even while his unit was vastly outnumbered. Despite being wounded, Fisher continued to direct his troops amidst the chaos until finally reinforcements arrived and the German force was repelled. Lieutenant Samuel Woodfill would become a national hero when he single handedly incapacitated three German machine gun nests and earned the nation’s highest military award, the Medal of Honor as well as military honors from several European nations. While suffering the effects of mustard gas exposure, Woodfill captured three of the gunners and finish off the rest in intense close-quarters combat where he was eventually forced to wield a trench pick as a combat weapon. At home, citizens continued to support the war effort through the Red Cross and Salvation Army, raising funds and sending supplies to the troops entrenched on the other side of the Atlantic. Women filled the jobs left empty by those men that had departed for the front, eager to serve their country. Among them was Opha Johnson of Kokomo who was the first woman to enlist in the Marine Corps. Welcome Home Day; Returned Soldiers on parade in Indianapolis She took over clerical work in the quartermaster department and was promoted to the rank of Sergeant by the war’s end17. This names only a few of the many outstanding Hoosiers who contributed to war effort, most of whom would not receive such recognition but who, beyond a doubt, contributed to the nation’s war effort, both overseas and at home. Over 135,000 Hoosiers would serve their country throughout the war. Of this number, more than 3,000 would make the ultimate sacrifice. The countless number of Hoosier soldiers, nurses, and civilians who were there to proudly serve and sacrifice for their nation, deserve more recognition than they have or could receive. They had demonstrated their commitment to the ideals of the United States and proven that, whenever their nation needed them, the men and women of Indiana would be there to answer to answer the call.

"United States Muster Rolls of the Marine Corps, 1798-1937" James B. Gresham (Aug. 23, 1893-Nov. 03, 1917) Among the first American Doughboys to be sent to the front, James Gresham was a Hoosier who would be one of American soldiers to die in the First World War. He was an average American from humble beginnings whose life was consistently characterized by personal sacrifice: both at home in Evansville, where he chose working to support his family over continuing his education, and on the Western Front where he was among the first Americans in World War I to make the ultimate sacrifice for his country and its ideals. James Bethel Gresham was one the first of America’s fallen heroes in France whose actions throughout his life reflected a sense of duty and selflessness. James Bethel Gresham was born to Alice Bethel Gresham (later Alice Dodd) and Green Gresham, on August 23, 1893 in Henderson, Kentucky. In September of 1901, the family moved a short 12 miles over the border to Evansville, Indiana. Here, James attended the Centennial School, which had been located between Indiana Street and Illinois Street. His education would not last very long however, as he ended his education not long after and began working in various factories to help support his family. On April 23, 1914, four months before his 21st birthday, James enlisted in the U. S. Army. After first being sent to Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis, Missouri, his unit was called to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas in June of 1914 to garrison and assist in patrolling the border with Mexico in response to the threat of paramilitary forces under the command Francisco “Pancho” Villa. Gresham would remain at Fort Bliss for the next three years. This changed on April 6, 1917, as the United States declared war on Germany and in June, James as a part of Company F, Second Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Division, would be called from Fort Bliss as a part of the American Expeditionary Forces in France under the command of Major General John J. Pershing. Gresham’s unit would be among the first of America’s forces to land in Europe at the port of Saint Nazaire, France on June 26, 1917. A week later on the 4th of July, Gresham as a part of the Second Battalion of the 16th Infantry marched in a parade through Paris to help bolster the morale of France’s population who greeted the Americans with enthusiasm. From there they moved on to a training area in Gondrecourt in where they conducted training in modern trench warfare under the French 47th Regiment of Alpine Chasseurs, regarded by one soldier of Gresham’s company as “the best trained and most courageous soldiers in the French army.” Upon completing training in Gondrecourt, they moved on to Demange-aux-Eau, where they continued to drill formations. On the 29th of October, the Second Battalion of the 16th Infantry Regiment received orders to relieve the First Battalion who had been holding the trenches in order to familiarize themselves with the conditions of trench warfare on the Western Front. This sector was regarded by the French as a quiet sector and the First Battalion’s ten-day occupation of the trenches had not seen anything that would discredit such a claim. On the night of November 2nd, the second battalion entered the trenches one mile from the small village of Bathelemont, near Nancy. Corporal James Gresham commanded a firing squad of the First Platoon of Company F in a trench salient that was reported to be one of the closest to enemy forces, estimated by one witness as merely 500 yards away. In the hours between two and three o’clock in the morning, German artillery began a barrage of artillery fire that gradually moved over Gresham’s trench, effectively cutting off the salient from their comrades. Under the cover of this barrage, German soldiers then began a raid of the trench with the intent to take as many supplies and prisoners as possible, a common tactic in the war that had been employed by both sides. Accounts of the fighting that took place vary, but all indicate that it was in extremely close-quarters, quickly becoming hand to hand, and in nearly complete darkness. Some accounts also suggest that the American sentries, in their first engagement with German soldiers, confused the oncoming Germans for fellow Americans in the pitch dark of the night. After a period of short but extremely intense fighting, the German forces withdrew with their casualties, a great number of supplies, and 11 American prisoners. After the raid ended and the barrage was lifted, American forces found five soldiers wounded and three dead. Among them: James Gresham, who had been killed in hand to hand combat. Five days later, the bodies of Gresham and his two fallen comrades were buried near the village of Bathelemont. The ceremony was attended by American and French soldiers with a French General reportedly speaking in praise of the bravery of the three soldiers and bidding them farewell. On this site, a monument would be erected by the French government in honor of these soldiers following the end of the war as well as another after World War II, as the original had been destroyed by German Forces in the 1940s. This monument remains there today, approximately 500 meters west of the village of Bathelemont. In July of 1921, Gresham’s body was returned to the United States at the request of his family and he was buried in Locust Hill Cemetery in Evansville, Indiana next to his brother and sister. In Evansville, markers and memorials would be placed in his honor, at the Evansville coliseum and at his home, to commemorate that it was one of their own who was among the first to make the ultimate sacrifice for his country and its ideals.

Samuel Woodfill (Jan. 06, 1883-Aug. 10, 1951) Praised as “Outstanding” by AEF commander General John Pershing, Samuel Woodfill would be resoundingly praised as a hero following his return from Europe during World War I. For his bravery and heroism, he would receive the Medal of Honor as well as numerous other military honors by European nations. Though Woodfill reportedly disliked publicity, Indiana’s war hero would receive no shortage of it as he met with presidents, was given a standing ovation in Congress, and was hand-picked to represent the Army’s infantry as pall bearer in the burial of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. Renowned for his incredible feats as a soldier and remarkable humility as a hero, the Outstanding Soldier of the World War was born and died a Hoosier. Samuel Woodfill was born in Belleview, Indiana in Jefferson County in January 06, 1883 to John and Christina Woodfill. His Father, John S. G. Woodfill, was reportedly a veteran of the Mexican War and fought in the Civil War with the 5th Indiana Volunteers. It is reported that at an early age Samuel was an excellent marksman, learning from his father at age 7. When Samuel was very young, at the age of 13, his father passed away. Continuing his father’s military legacy, Samuel Woodfill enlisted in the Army in 1901 in Bryantsburg, Indiana at age 18. He was initially sent to the Philippines which had recently come under control of the United States. In 1904 he was reported to be stationed in Alaska at Fort Egbert where Woodfill rose to the rank of sergeant by 1911. In 1912 he was stationed at Fort Thomas, Kentucky for two years until in 1914 his unit was sent to the Mexican Border to protect from bandit attacks against Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona by Francisco “Pancho” Villa. Shortly after the United States’ entrance into World War I, Woodfill would return to Fort Thomas where he would meet Lorena Blossom Wiltshire, whom he would marry on December 25, 1917. After being promoted to Lieutenant, in April 1918 he was dispatched to Europe as part of the 60th Infantry, Fifth Division. His division would be sent to the Meuse-Argonne front in the Fall of 1918 where they would participate in part of the final Allied offensive of World War I and the main engagement of the war involving the American Expeditionary Forces. This offensive would begin in late September of 1918 and continue until the signing of the armistice in November. It was during this offensive that the commander of M Company of the 60th Infantry Regiment, 1st Lieutenant Samuel Woodfill, would earn his place in history as a war hero. On the morning of October 12 near Cunel, France, his company came under heavy machinegun fire, holding up the advance. Woodfill would proceed towards a machine gun nest being accompanied by only two privates which followed at 25 yards. Upon flanking the gun, it stopped firing and the gun’s crew of four soldiers emerged. Woodfill shot and killed three of the gun’s crew and was rushed by the fourth, an officer, whom he killed with his pistol after engaging in hand-to-hand combat. His company proceeded forward where a second machine gun nest was encountered and Woodfill rushed ahead under heavy fire, killing members of the crew and capturing three of them. Upon encountering a third machine gun nest, Woodfill once again charged into the first pit, killing five enemy soldiers with his rifle and drew his revolver to engage the second pit where the two enemy soldiers turned the gun on him. After failing to kill them with his revolver, he picked up a nearby trench-pick which he used to kill both enemy soldiers. At this point he was suffering from exposure to mustard gas as well as exhausted but managed to make it back to American lines and was hospitalized in Bordeaux. For his actions, Woodfill was awarded the Medal of Honor, presented to him by General John Pershing in Chaumont, France on February 09, 1919. In addition to this honor, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre with palm by the French Government and was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. He was also presented a Meriot di Guerra by the government of Italy and the Cross of Prince Danilo by Montenegro. With these awards he also received a promotion to Captain. Woodfill would see no further action during the war which would end one month later. His term in the military would run out in 1919 but Woodfill would reenlist; however, upon reenlistment he would lose his rank of captain. There were local efforts to push Congress to allow Woodfill to retire with a rank of sergeant but on a Captain’s pension, however this would ultimately fail, as Woodfill had the opportunity to take the examination for captaincy but opted not to. After arriving home in Fort Thomas, Kentucky on November 26, 1921, he would find it difficult to make house payments on just a sergeant’s pay. In 1922, he received leave from the army to work on a dam on the Ohio River at Silver Grove Kentucky where he reportedly earned six dollars a day, roughly double his sergeant’s pay, in order to make payments on his home in Fort Thomas. Upon seeing a picture of Woodfill working on the dam, the Keith Theatre Interests in New York City gave $10,000 to pay off the mortgage on his home as well as pay up some life insurance for Woodfill, causing the sergeant to gratefully offer thanks to “those who made possible the freeing of our home from debt.” Following his return home, Samuel Woodfill would spend a great deal of time in the spotlight, though it was often said that this was not an experienced which he very much enjoyed. Despite Woodfill’s aversion to the limelight, his fame would only grow as General Pershing recognized him as one of the most outstanding soldiers of the war and chose him to represent the infantry as pallbearer for the body of the Unknown Soldier buried at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on November 11, 1921. In addition, Woodfill would be honored around the country, receiving a standing ovation from the House of Representatives with a reception being held in his honor, as well as a meeting with President Warren G. Harding who upon praising Woodfill as an outstanding soldier commented that “when he shook hands with me he had the grip of a fighting man.” Throughout these events, Woodfill’s humility was repeatedly noted, declining to seek promotion to captaincy, feeling uncomfortable before crowds, and even expressing frustration when being called to Washington to receive honors, reportedly telling his wife he was tired of “being a circus pony,” lamenting how “every time there is something going on they trot me out to perform.” Later on, he would also meet and be photographed with President Calvin Coolidge. Locally, Woodfill was an even bigger hero with, in 1922 a school at Fort Thomas being named in his honor. Woodfill would be brought back into the spotlight repeatedly in the years to come despite reportedly wishing “I hope there won’t be any more written about Woodfill.” In 1923, Woodfill would be discharged from the Army with full military honors and the rank of master sergeant. Two years later, Woodfill bought a farm of about 60 acres in Campbell County, Kentucky, reportedly with the hopes of making the land into a profitable orchard; however this would be unsuccessful. To keep his farm and deal with his now accumulated $2,000 debt, he began working as a watchman, starting in 1929, and would continue at that job until America’s entrance into World War II. In 1942 at the age of 59, Woodfill was commissioned a major in the United States Army, serving as an instructor in Birmingham, Alabama training infantry during the war. When Woodfill left for Alabama in 1942, it would be the last time he would see his wife. She would die on March 26, 1942 at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati. When he once again resigned from the army, he chose not return to his empty home in Kentucky, instead chose to move back to Jefferson County, Indiana, where he had been born, and bought a small farm. On August 13, 1951, Samuel Woodfill was found dead on his farm at the age of 68, reportedly having died of natural causes several days prior. He was initially buried at Hebron cemetery in Jefferson County near Madison. Four years later, his body was moved to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery with honors, approximately 50 feet from the grave of General John Pershing. In addition, a memorial would be erected in his honor at Springdale Cemetery in Madison, Indiana.
